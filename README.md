AudioFill is an innovative machine learning project leveraging audio processing and deep learning techniques to detect liquid pouring sounds to identify when a container is full. This project aims for self exploration in the ML field and is still in progress.

Key features and technologies:

- Developed using Python, TensorFlow, and NumPy for data processing and model training.
- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze spectrograms of pouring sounds.
- Created a mobile app that records audio in real-time and processes it using the trained model.
- Provides instant notifications to users when the desired fill level is reached.

The model was trained using https://github.com/eldadohana/AudioFill-ML
